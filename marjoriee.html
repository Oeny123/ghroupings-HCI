                        Life without technology<b> wouldn't be functional or enjoyable for most of us.</b> Keep the world running by getting into IT. Imagine this: You wake up one day in a world without technology – all the computers on the planet just disappeared. First of all, you'd wake up late because your smartphone alarm no longer exists.

                        Long before the technology people had to use a tool called a pen and other equipment to actually write messages to one another. The finished message would need to be enclosed in more paper that called envelope, postage needed to be paid and then the delivery raider will sent to the sender.

                        Technology in the past was meant to simply help society with problems, such as creating the lightbulb in place of candlelight. Nowadays, technology has strayed from simply being helpful, and has become something that we, the creators, are unable to fully explain or control. It has far surpassed its original goals of shining a light on a dark room.
