                        <b>Advantages</b>
                    </p>

                    <p>Technology has given many positive effect to the average person as it’s mostly used for communication, finding jobs and for learning these alone have a major effects.</p>
                    <p>One of the example use for technology as I’ve said is 
<br>
<br>
                        <b>Communication</b> – you an average person can talk to people in different places without being there yourself it wont matter how far you are as long as the receiver have internet or telocommunication signal you can talk to them and it just proven to be more usefull becasue the entire world is in a pandemic, online learning, freelancing all this require communication and technolog does a freat work on making it happen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Job Finding</b> – as jobs become hard to find you’ll need other ways of getting it and one of these other ways is through technology there are many freelance applications or softwares you can use for freelancing, although you are limited to what jobs you can do in freelancing most indemand jobs does not require you to go outside like app development, web dev, graphic design etc... this is a big help to people who are looking for experience and quick money to start a business.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Learning</b> – one of the better ways of using technology is probobly this, there are many ways of learning with the use of technology one of this is self studying almost any information you want to know or learn can be searched via internet this can help many people who want to expand thier knowledge and have better oppotunities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are many more but I’m not ganna explain them all but here’s a few list.
                        <ol>
                            <li>News</li>
                            <li>Shopping</li>
                            <li>Documentation</li>
                            <li>Entertainment
                                <br>
                                etc...
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                </div>
               
            </div>
            <div class="box2-con">
                <div class="box2 transform">
                    <p>
                        <b>Dis-Advantages</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now were finish in the advantages lets takle its dis-advantages. There are many ways this is dis-advatagious all we need to know is its advatages and turn it over for example 
    <br>
    <br>
                        <b>Communication</b> – scammers all over the globe can take this to their advantages as they will not only be out scamming people they can also be hard to track down because the main target would be people from other countries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Job Finding</b> – this is a very costly and dangerious act because it also risk the life of the target or “client” they can give you a fake ticket promising you a chance to work abroad but in truth they are just taking money from you or making you stowaway which is very illligal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Learning</b> – this is a bit of stretch now a days if pretty rare but its there example of this are some tutorials from youtube since they removed the dislike button the averange person will not know the validity of the lesson some post a comment saying its fake but they can also be blocked by the owner and if you fell for this it will only make you look stupid and a moron although it wont cause you anything some people promise a course by paying no reports I’ve heared yet but it can be done.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To further prove this I will show how the other can be turn upside-down.
                        <ol>
                            <li>News = Fake News</li>
                            <li>Shopping = Getting Scammed</li>
