                <p>1.	 Better Interaction </p>
                <p>Communication is instant now. It is how technology has affected communication in the modern world. We were expected to wait for several days and even months to receive a reply from the other side in earlier times. This modern era has eliminated this requirement. Technology has come up with new ways of communication; online means being the most prevalent one. It is common to meet people of different cultures and communities on online forums and instantly communicate with them. Chat rooms and discussion forums enable people to meet each other without having to be there in person. This has given them much more flexibility when it comes to dealing with social anxiety. Online relationships are now becoming a social norm. 
                </p>
                <p>2.	Speed</p>
                <p>Speed is clearly the biggest improvement communication has experienced through technology. Modern communication is instant. You receive the message the other is trying to convey within milliseconds. Wireless signals, satellites, undersea cables, and other advanced technology helps communication by ensuring instant messages and other forms of data to any location on the planet. It also means the user doesn’t have to be physically present at specific places like the post office or mail room. Instead, he can send the message from the comfort of his home or anywhere his phone finds a signal.         
                 </p>
                <p>3.	 Reliability</p>
                <p>Electronically transmitting these messages is much more reliable than using physical letters. Chatting apps are a norm now, which eliminates the possibility of an error happening in the transmission. As long as data lines are secure, you can rely on your device to convey the message on the other side. However, it can get hindered due to glitches and errors from weather conditions or human faults.There is one risk of hackers trying to steal data and information shared on communication platforms. However, most messaging platforms like WhatsApp come with end-to-end encryption, making it hard for the developers to decrypt them.
                </p>
                <p>4.	 Easy Self Service </p>
                <p>Another example of technology improving communication includes easy self-service. It allows customers to order products using voice commands on IoT quickly. They can also try out the products using augmented reality without interacting with company associates and employees. Most information and queries related to products and services are available easily on the company’s website. The customer can seek an answer by visiting the forum or knowledge base on the website. Some companies also provide video tutorials, articles, walkthrough guides, onboarding emails, etc.
                </p>
                <p>5.	Marketing</p>
                <p>Technology improves communication and is improving rapidly every day. Smartphone users have been increasing and have now marked 3.8 million users in 2021, as stated by Statista. If a company wants to reach this audience and beat its competitor, it can’t rely on a traditional marketing way. The competition in marketing has increased significantly, given the number of methods available to reach the target audience. Some trending ways include SMS marketing, paid Facebook and YouTube ads, email marketing, app ads, Google ads, banner ads, game ads, full-screen/interstitial ads, and sticky ads.
