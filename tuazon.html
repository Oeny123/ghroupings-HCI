The invention of the automobile has changed the notions of transportation. Similarly, the concept of communication has evolved radically since Graham Bell invented the first telephone. Technology and communication are two sides of the same coin. Technology in communication is affecting us in so many ways.

                        <br>
                        <b>1. Better Interaction</b>
                        <br>
                            Communication is instant now. It is how technology has affected communication in the modern world. We were expected to wait for several days and even months to receive a reply from the other side in earlier times. This modern era has eliminated this requirement. Technology has come up with new ways of communication; online means being the most prevalent one. It is common to meet people of different cultures and communities on online forums and instantly communicate with them. Chat rooms and discussion forums enable people to meet each other without having to be there in person. This has given them much more flexibility when it comes to dealing with social anxiety. Online relationships are now becoming a social norm.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Social media platforms Twitter, WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, etc., are examples of how communication has changed. It allows people to connect with anyone globally. It also allows people to show their skills and creativity to the whole world. Some people also use the platforms to voice their opinions and raise concerns over a specific issue; sometimes, they can read the news, get informed, and learn different skills online.

                            <br>
                        <b>2. Speed</b>
                        <br>
                            Speed is clearly the biggest improvement communication has experienced through technology. Modern communication is instant. You receive the message the other is trying to convey within milliseconds. Wireless signals, satellites, undersea cables, and other advanced technology helps communication by ensuring instant messages and other forms of data to any location on the planet. It also means the user doesn’t have to be physically present at specific places like the post office or mail room. Instead, he can send the message from the comfort of his home or anywhere his phone finds a signal.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Initially, users sometimes faced problems sending and receiving messages via mobile phones. But as the technology improved, internet speed/strength also increased with time and still improving every day. Even people in remote areas are connected with the world. People are virtually connected, which is a result of improved communication systems.                            <br>

                        <b>3. Reliability</b>
                        <br>
                        Electronically transmitting these messages is much more reliable than using physical letters. Chatting apps are a norm now, which eliminates the possibility of an error happening in the transmission. As long as data lines are secure, you can rely on your device to convey the message on the other side. However, it can get hindered due to glitches and errors from weather conditions or human faults.

                        There is one risk of hackers trying to steal data and information shared on communication platforms. However, most messaging platforms like WhatsApp come with end-to-end encryption, making it hard for the developers to decrypt them.

They can also try out the products using augmented reality without interacting with company associates and employees. Most information and queries related to products and services are available easily on the company’s website. The customer can seek an answer by visiting the forum or knowledge base on the website. Some companies also provide video tutorials, articles, walkthrough guides, onboarding emails, etc.

                        Public Relations managers are professionals who maintain a company’s or individual’s public image. The accessibility of the Internet and social media platforms has made the maintenance of public relations more challenging. The reputed companies and celebrities are usually more vulnerable to the public. People can instantly share anything done by them by clicking pictures, shooting videos, taking screenshots, and uploading it on the Internet. The social media platforms make these viral shots accessible to everyone. Additionally, people can quickly post their views and discuss companies and celebrities independently. It makes them more susceptible to negative sentiments.

                        However, this feature comes with some disadvantages, such as the risk of data breaches and information security. If the company implements this policy, it must prepare the IT department/vendor and the management team to review and manage employees’ devices. Nevertheless, it can prevent security risks and unauthorized access to the company’s secrets. With regular devices audits, the company can successfully use personal technology and benefit itself.
